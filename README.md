## Whalegarden

Hi Tailwarden team, here's what I've built for the coding challenge.

It's a project built using Next.js (because I wanted to build fast), Tailwind (because I wanted to build fast, I like it and it begins with "Tailw-"), and Typescript (because I'm not afraid to being shouted at for making mistakes).

## Demo

Live demo is available: [https://whalegarden.netlify.app/](https://whalegarden.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

Please, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the it.

You can also run:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

and open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to see Storybook.

## Thank you very much for checking
